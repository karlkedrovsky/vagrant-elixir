# Vagrant - Elixir

Simple Ubuntu 16.04 VM for Elixir development.

The provisioning bits assume that you have my [shared ansible roles project](https://github.com/karlkedrovsky/shared-ansible-roles) cloned at the same directory level as this repo. To change that edit the ansible.cfg file in this repo.
